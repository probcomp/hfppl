[LLaMPPL](https://github.com/probcomp/hfppl) is a research prototype for language model probabilistic programming: specifying language generation tasks by writing probabilistic programs that combine calls to LLMs, symbolic program logic, and probabilistic conditioning. To solve these tasks, LLaMPPL uses a specialized sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithm.

This technique, SMC steering, is described in our workshop abstract, [Sequential Monte Carlo Steering of Large Language Models using Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03081).
